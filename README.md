# ENGO 645 - Group Project: Traffic Incident Analysis

This project is a course requirement for **ENGO 645 – Spatial Databases and Data Mining**.

## 📝 Project Description:
**Predicting Traffic Incident Hotspots Using Spatial and Temporal Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting traffic incidents in the City of Calgary using spatial and temporal data mining techniques. Traffic disruptions—caused by signal failures, hazardous road conditions, stalled vehicles, or collisions—pose major challenges to urban safety and mobility.

## 🧠 Objectives:
Using publicly available traffic incident data, we aim to:
- 📊 Explore temporal patterns (peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends, seasonal trends).
- 🗺️ Identify geospatial hotspots using clustering algorithms like **DBSCAN**.
- 📈 Build a machine learning regression model to predict the frequency of incidents based on spatial and temporal features.

The results of this project will help reveal **when and where** traffic incidents are most likely to occur, providing actionable insights for traffic planners, emergency responders, and city decision-makers.
